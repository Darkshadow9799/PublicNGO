# PublicNGO
> By Aayush Jain

## Summary:
* PublicNGO is a platform that provides a single platform for public and NGO to collaborate.
With this it also allows the public to use the NGO data to perform an efficient way of donation. This will allow donation to actually required people instead of having wastage of it

* Also people will collaborate for nearby donation camps and help NGOs. This will lead to networking between the people. A donation button is provided on site which will let people donate anything they want and all the use of the product/money donated by the donors will be known to the people as per transacted and each transaction will be open to the people.
